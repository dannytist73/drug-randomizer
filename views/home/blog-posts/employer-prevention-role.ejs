            Beyond Testing: Creating Supportive Work Environments
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Workplace substance abuse is a significant concern affecting employee health, safety, productivity, 
            and the overall work environment. While drug testing programs are an important component of 
            addressing substance abuse in the workplace, employers have a much broader role to play in 
            prevention. Creating a comprehensive approach that focuses on education, supportive policies, 
            and a healthy workplace culture can significantly reduce substance abuse issues while promoting 
            employee wellbeing.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            This article explores how employers can develop proactive strategies beyond testing to prevent 
            workplace substance abuse, support affected employees, and foster a healthier, more productive 
            work environment.

            Conclusion
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Employers have a unique opportunity to play a pivotal role in preventing workplace substance 
            abuse and supporting employee wellness. While drug testing is one important component, truly 
            effective prevention requires a comprehensive approach that addresses workplace culture, 
            provides education and support resources, and balances accountability with compassion.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            By implementing these strategies, employers not only reduce the risks and costs associated 
            with workplace substance abuse but also create healthier, more supportive work environments 
            where all employees can thrive. The investment in prevention and support programs typically 
            yields significant returns in terms of improved productivity, reduced accidents and absenteeism, 
            and a more positive workplace culture.
