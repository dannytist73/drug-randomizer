    Understanding Types of Treatment
  </h2>
  <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
    Before exploring specific facilities, it's important to understand the
    different types of treatment approaches and programs available. Each serves
    a unique purpose in the recovery process, and many individuals benefit from

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">
    1. Detoxification Services
  </h3>
  <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Detoxification, or detox, is often the first step in treatment. It focuses
    on managing acute withdrawal symptoms when a person stops using substances.
    Professional medical supervision is critical during this phase to ensure
    safety.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-8 space-y-2">
    <li class="leading-relaxed">
      <strong class="font-semibold text-blue-600">Medical detox</strong> -
      Provides medication and medical supervision to manage withdrawal symptoms
      safely

      <strong class="font-semibold text-blue-600">Hospital-based detox</strong>
      - Offers 24-hour medical care during the detoxification process

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">
    2. Inpatient/Residential Treatment
  </h3>
  <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Residential treatment involves staying at a facility for a period of time
    (typically 30-90 days) to receive intensive care and therapy in a structured
    environment.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-8 space-y-2">

  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">
    3. Outpatient Treatment
  </h3>
  <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Outpatient programs allow individuals to live at home while attending
    scheduled treatment sessions. These programs vary in intensity and are often
    used as step-down care after inpatient treatment or for those with milder
    substance use disorders.
  </p>

    <p class="italic text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      "Many people believe that treatment is a one-size-fits-all approach, but
      effective recovery often involves a combination of services tailored to
      individual needs. What works for one person may not work for another, and
      treatment plans often need to be adjusted as a person progresses through
      their recovery journey. In Baguio City, we're fortunate to have a spectrum
      of services that can be combined to create personalized recovery paths."
