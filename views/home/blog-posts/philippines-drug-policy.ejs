                Understanding the Legal Framework
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Drug policy in the Philippines operates within a complex legal framework aimed at addressing drug abuse, trafficking, and rehabilitation. The cornerstone of this framework is Republic Act No. 9165, also known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, which has been amended by Republic Act No. 10640 and subsequent legislation.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                This legal framework establishes the definition of illegal drugs, sets penalties for various drug-related offenses, outlines procedures for law enforcement, and creates the institutional structure for addressing drug issues in the country. Understanding this framework is essential for anyone seeking to navigate the legal landscape surrounding drugs in the Philippines.

                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Understanding the Philippines' drug policy framework is essential for anyone seeking to navigate the system, whether as someone struggling with substance abuse, a family member, a healthcare provider, or a concerned citizen. While the policy framework includes strong enforcement components, it also provides mechanisms for treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                The ongoing evolution of drug policy in the Philippines reflects a growing recognition of the complexity of substance abuse issues and the need for comprehensive approaches that address both supply and demand reduction while respecting human dignity and the right to health. By staying informed about legal provisions, available resources, and emerging developments, individuals can better advocate for themselves and their communities in addressing drug-related challenges.
